            &nbsp;
            Hundreds of years ago, invaders from the sky ravaged the land and almost destroyed the world. To repel the invaders, five mages joined together and cast a powerful barrier to ward the invaders away, atop a huge tower, the "Mercedes Caulis", becoming known as the first "Magia Vander". The Rigarden Magical Academy is focused on training magicians, including those strong enough to become Magia Vander themselves and continue the legacy of maintaining the barrier that protects the kingdom.
            <br><br>
            &nbsp;Will Serfort is a Rigarden student who swore to become a magician strong enough to be accepted into the Mercedes Caulis and reunite with his childhood friend, Elfaria Albis Serfort, the youngest magician ever to become a Magia Vander. However, Will has no magic aptitude at all, having managed to progress on his studies so far with the perfect scores on written tests and the extra credits obtained from hunting monsters in the school's dungeon, but only a few people know his true power, as what he lacks in magic, he makes up with his swordsmanship, capable of defeating powerful monsters that even the strongest magicians have difficulties against. As Will keeps pushing toward his dream, he makes friends and enemies along the way while showing his true powers which shake the very foundations of the world.

          &nbsp;Will's childhood friend. She is a prodigal magician who quickly rose through the ranks and became the youngest ever to become a Magia Vander, commanding the ice faction. However, privately, she is a slacker who pushes her responsibilities onto her subordinates, spending her days waiting for Will to fulfill their promise to reunite with her.
          Specializing in ice magic, she created a total of twelve original spells, an unprecedented feat.
